# Hand Gesture Detection on Raspberry Pi

This project is a simple hand gesture detection system that run on a Raspberry Pi. The system is able to detect 11 different hand gestures with a high accuracy. Currently, the system is able to detect the following hand gestures (more gestures can be added easily):

- thumbs_up
- thumbs_down
- closed_fist
- open_palm
- ok
- victory
- yo
- call_me
- pinch
- pointing
- horns

This project draws inspiration from the [Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe](https://github.com/Kazuhito00/hand-gesture-recognition-using-mediapipe) repository. The main difference is that this project is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi and it is optimized for real-time performance. It also includes a streaming server that allows us to visualize the detected hand gestures on a web browser.
